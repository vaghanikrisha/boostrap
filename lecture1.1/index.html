        Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. As of March 2023
        , Apple is the world's largest company by market capitalization,[6] and with US$394.3 billion the largest technology
        company by 2022 revenue.[7] As of June 2022, Apple is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales;
        the largest manufacturing company by revenue; and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world.
        It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google),
        Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.

    Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak,
    Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.
    It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer,
    the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers.
    Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces,
    including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called "1984". By 1985
    , the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple
    and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.

    As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s,
    Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones
    (also known as "Wintel"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to

    resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade,
    Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod,
    iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the "Think different" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.

    Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018
    , then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion.[8]
    The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics,
    including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level
    of brand loyalty. It has also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px;">HISTORY</h2>
    
    <p class="bg-info text-white">Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[9][12] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[13] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[14]: 57  Neither received the full selling price but in total earned $1,300 (equivalent to $6,700 in 2022). Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[15] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[16] It went on sale soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,400 in 2022).[17][18]: 180  Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".[19]

        Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[20][21] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[22] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,207,000 in 2022) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[23] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[24]
        
        The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[25] It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[26][27]
        
        The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer application" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[26] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office,[26] but Apple II market share remained behind home computers made by competitors such as Atari, Commodore, and Tandy.[28][29]
        
        On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol "AAPL") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022),[21] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[30] By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share[31] and a market cap of $1.778 billion.[30][31]
        
        1980–1990: Success with Macintosh
        See also: List of Mac models and Timeline of the Apple II family
        
        The Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.
        A critical moment in the company's history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees, including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000[32] shares (22.4 million split-adjusted shares as of September 3, 2022)[21] of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[33] After the demonstration, Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.[34]
        
        The Lisa division was plagued by infighting, and in 1982, Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first mass marketed personal computer with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software library.[35]
        
        Jobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as a low-cost computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[36] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[37]
        
        In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer without a bundled programming language.[38] Its debut was signified by "1984", a $1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[39] This was hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[40] and was called a "masterpiece" by CNN[41] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide.[42]
